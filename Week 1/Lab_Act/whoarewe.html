    <h3><u>Who are we?</u></h3>
    <p>Basically, we are <b>students from different schools</b>, gathered to provide other students from <u>inside AND outside</u> the university, with services that they need and which we also happen to excel at. We have members from Design and Media, Ethical Hacking, Computer Science, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.
    <br>
    we help in building module-based projects for other students and we also built a graduation project for a group of member from outside our university.</p>
